# random-forest

A pure python implementation of the [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) and [random forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) classifiers. This is a college assignement that I'm uploading to github as an example of python code that I'm proud of. It makes heavy use of functional programming, type annotations and dataclasses.
